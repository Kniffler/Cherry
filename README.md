# Cherry
This is the official repository for CherryBot. A discord bot who's code is entirely changeable within Discord. This repository is updated in real time

# Concept
The idea is to have a [Discord](discord.gg) bot that you can send custom files to. Each file sent represents a custom command the bot can execute. Before any of this, the owner of the bot has to be pointed out on Discord using /calibrate. This is to initialize the Discord profile of the owner.
